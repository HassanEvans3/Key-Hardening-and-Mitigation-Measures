📁 Project Overview: Linux Server Hardening for BSC
This project presents a comprehensive approach to hardening a Linux server for The Baker Street Corporation (BSC)—an organization responsible for handling highly sensitive and confidential data. Acting as a security professional, my objective was to audit, secure, and automate critical components of the server to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure long-term system resilience.

🎯 Objectives & Scope
The project was executed in three structured phases:

🔐 Day 1: User, Group, and File Security
Performed a full system inventory and backup.

Audited users and groups to identify misconfigurations and unnecessary accounts.

Enforced strong password policies and expiration rules.

Reviewed and updated sudo permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

Validated and corrected file and directory permissions to restrict unauthorized access.

⚙️ Day 2: System Configuration Hardening
Secured SSH configuration to minimize remote access risk.

Updated and patched all system packages.

Disabled unnecessary services to reduce the system's attack surface.

Enabled and configured logging to support system monitoring and future audits.

🛠️ Day 3: Automation and Reporting
Scripted all major hardening tasks completed on Days 1 and 2.

Scheduled scripts to enforce security configurations automatically.

Compiled a summary report documenting all implemented security measures.
